Playing pottermore , i thought i try to write a script that helps me cast more accurate spells. 
its using a packaged called uinput to simulate the keyboard press .
the script needs root access to run . 

i have implemented 3 spells . 

i suspect that the timing will need some fine tuning in other pcs but never tried it.

also i wasn't able to get the accuracy above 143 . 
and sometimes for a weird reason it misses up so the accuracy is between 139 -143 . and on most cases it scores 142.

u need to run the script it will count 3 seconds then fire up . that gives u time to select the pottermore window and keep it on focus . also  u need to comment / uncomment the spell u wana use. im planning to build a better interface and increase accuracy if i have time .



i used the script made by : http://www.hashbangcode.com/blog/using-python-beat-2012-olympic-google-doodles-669.html


and uinput source on github : https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput
