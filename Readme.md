# Potter More Spell Caster

Playing pottermore, I thought I try to write a script that helps me cast more accurate spells. 
its using a package called uinput to simulate the keyboard press.

I have implemented 3 spells. 

## Known issues

- I suspect that the timing will need some fine tuning in other pcs but never tried it.

- Also I wasn't able to get the accuracy above 143, and sometimes for a weird reason it misses up 
so the accuracy is between 139 -143, and on most cases it scores 142.

- Im planning to build a better interface and increase accuracy if i have time .

## Using it

* You need to run the script it will count 3 seconds then fire up. That gives you time to select the pottermore window and keep it on focus. Also  You need to comment\uncomment the spell you wanna use. 

* The script needs root access to run. 

## Project is based on

I used the script made by: http://www.hashbangcode.com/blog/using-python-beat-2012-olympic-google-doodles-669.html

and 'uinput' source on Github: https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput
